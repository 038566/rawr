{"tagline":"no","body":"Blender\r\n=========\r\n\r\nThe Blender directory contains several full addons and part scripts.\r\n\r\n  - Mesh Editing\r\n  - Tile Rendering (Monster Tile Renderer)\r\n  - Text Editor addons\r\n\r\nThe difference between an addon and a script is mostly the addition of boilerplate code to make the addon show up in the addon loader in user-preferences.\r\n\r\n> \"The scripts and addons presented here are mostly written out of the need to have\r\n> some kind of automation turn into a one click event. If you use any software relentlessly\r\n> you will want to avoid the scenario that turns you into a complex input machine rather than\r\n> a creative user of the software. Scripting is the answer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI've written a tonne of Blender scripts but this repo focusses only on those that i frequently return to to steal code from, or *actually* use a lot.  \r\n\r\n\r\nInstalling Addons is easy.\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nTo install an Addon properly:\r\n\r\n1. Inside `blender/../scripts/` plonk the content of addons_contrib\r\n2. In `User Preferences -> addons -> all` look for the addon name and tick it\r\n3. You don't need to install addons permanently, it's probably a good idea not to\r\n4. If you find yourself using an addon a lot, then certainly configure blender to include it permanently\r\n5. Permanent installation I do using `ctrl+U` after enabling an addon right from a default start.blend file.\r\n6. There are other ways, so use those if you are more comfortable\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning non Addon scripts\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nOne way to run scripts that aren't equipped with the addon boilerplate is to simply open them in the text editor and press `ctrl+p` or the run button.\r\nThere is some convenience to this method: you can save the script with the .blend and the script will travel with it. The downside is that the script\r\ndoes travel with the .blend and can be a source of confusion to a recipient. Generally a short description of the script at the very top using docstring \r\nstyle quotes will ease the blocking points.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
