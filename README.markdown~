This repository contains my favourite homebrew scripts. Any future blender scripting that I do will be available from here. 

`/addons_contrib/text_editor_extras/`  
- text editor eval selection: will eval the current selection and replace it with the result
- text editor chroma key: a one click method to enable syntax highlighting and ruler etc

`/addons_contrib/io_material_loader/`  
- an example of how to link_append from other blender files, to turn them into a library.

`/addons_contrib/io_import_mesh_afm_ascii/`  
- this addon reads ascii format Atomic Force Microscope data files and generates a mesh from the z data grid

`/addons_contrib/`  
- monster tile v3 005.py: is a region/border/tile renderer for cycles and blender internal, useful for when you don't have enough ram to render a scene. I also wrote a couple of different scripts to automatically stitch these tiles together. [More info here](https://github.com/zeffii/Monster_Tile_Renderer/wiki/Monster-Tile-Renderer---Info-sheet.) 
- txt editor gist import addon.py: feed it a gist reference and it will download the file into the text editor
- mesh edge intersection tools.py: edge projection(V), edge extention(T) and edge intersection(X) tool. (ugly but battle hardened). Included in [Blenders SVN for addons_contrib](http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Modeling/Edge_Slice)
- Empty placing addon.py: places empties at selected vertex locations.

`/image_manipulation/`  
- firefly removal extended.py: this is a tentative and primative approach to dealing with obvious fireflies automatically without imploying bidirectional smoothing. discontinued due to better cycles algorythms and special composite nodes. It's a very interesting field!

`/templates/`  
- operator and button 3dview.py: i use this to quickly load a boilerplate for random projects, includes references to often used views.

`/svg_tests/`  
- bpy to svg.py: can render the currently selected object from 3dview as an svg and writes it out onto the filesystem.
